	<p>I am an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation. Prior to joining RAND, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research.</p>
	<p>I earned my PhD in political science at Michigan State University. My dissertation, which involved both fieldwork in Lebanon and large-scale data analysis, explored how armed non-state groups strategically use violence and media to influence the public. My research is published or accepted at the <i>Journal of Politics</i>, <i>Political Behavior</i>, <i>International Interactions</i>, and <i>Civil Wars</i>.</p>

<!-- 	<p>My research broadly focuses on how armed actors involved in civil conflicts manage their relationships with non-combatants. I am particularly interested in how these groups use different forms of media and their effect on civilian attitudes.</p> -->
