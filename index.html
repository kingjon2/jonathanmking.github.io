	<p>I am an Associate Political Scientist at the RAND Corporation, where I am part of the Acquisition and Technology Policy Program. I am also a Lecturer at the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Security and Technology (CMIST).</p>
	
	<p>My research at RAND is primarily focused on the assessment of emerging technologies, with a special emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for national security. In particular, I have worked extensively with the special operations community to conduct capability reviews and evaluate potential investments in strategic technologies.</p>

	<p>I earned my PhD in Political Science from Michigan State University and completed a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research. My research has been published in or accepted at the <i>Journal of Politics</i>, <i>Political Behavior</i>, <i>International Interactions</i>, and <i>Civil Wars</i>.</p>

<!-- 	<p>My research broadly focuses on how armed actors involved in civil conflicts manage their relationships with non-combatants. I am particularly interested in how these groups use different forms of media and their effect on civilian attitudes.</p> -->
